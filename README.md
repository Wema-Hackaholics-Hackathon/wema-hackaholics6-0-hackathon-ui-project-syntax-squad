## 🎯 The Problem
Digital payments only move money—but what if they could do more?
What if receiving a salary could automatically trigger savings?
What if splitting a bill could feel social instead of transactional?
What if small business owners could unlock insights directly from their payment history?

Today, payments lack context and miss these opportunities.
They are utilities, when they could be experiences.
