 COPYWRITING RULES
Say the most with the least.

Every word should earn its place.

Cut fluff. Eliminate redundancy.

Example: Don’t say “Claim Voting Rewards” if the UI already says “Voting.”

Label based on what the user is doing, not what you think the system is doing.

If the user is claiming rewards, label it that way—not “earn tokens.”

Prioritize clarity > cleverness.

Simple, descriptive text wins.

Outsource clarity checks.

Screenshot your UI and ask ChatGPT for clearer, shorter alternatives (with context).

🎨 VISUAL DESIGN RULES
Visuals must serve a clear communication goal.

If users can’t tell what matters instantly, you failed.

Don't default to trendy effects.

Gradients, shadows, and blur are tools, not decoration. Use them only if you can pull them off.

If unsure, simplify.

A clean, boring chart is better than a confusing, sexy one.

Use repetition with purpose.

Reuse visual patterns to create meaning and connection (e.g., pulsing dot in two parts of the UI = relationship).

🌈 COLOR RULES
Too much color = no hierarchy.

If everything screams, nothing gets attention.

Use the 60/30/10 rule.

60% neutral (white, gray)

30% complementary (black or muted tones)

10% accent (your brand color)

Assign meaning to colors.

If red = alert or attention, don't spray it everywhere.

Tints and shades > more colors.

One color used well is more powerful than five used poorly.

🅰️ TYPOGRAPHY RULES
Limit font sizes and weights.

Use only what’s needed. Every variation must serve a function.
Use font variations intentionally.
Consider monospace for numbers to improve readability and alignment.
Typography = structure.
It sets the rhythm, flow, and readability of the entire interface.

📐 SPACING & STRUCTURE RULES
Random spacing = amateur hour.

Avoid arbitrary pixel values like 11px or 25px.

Use the 8-point (or 4-point) grid system.


Desgin like a Senior Level designer (7+ years):

Design with restraint. Communicate more with less.

Drive real business impact through clarity, precision, and usability.

🎞️ HIDDEN RULE: DESIGN LIKE A FILMMAKER
UI isn’t just static screens.

It’s flow, rhythm, and emotion.

Think: how does one screen transition into the next?

Create experiences, not just layouts.

Motion and storytelling matter.
